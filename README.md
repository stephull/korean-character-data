# korean-character-data
Dataset for all possible combinations of Korean alphabet

## Purpose
This repository holds all possible combinations of the Korean alphabet. Each file contains all possible combinations based on first consonant and vowel combinations, with each .csv and .json object file differentiating every array of characters by its, or lack of, second consonant, which concludes the unique Korean character. 

<b>The data is intended for a personal project of mine, although this dataset is publically available to anyone who needs a dataset of Korean characters. </b>

## Contents
Every .csv file orients a matrix of characters based on the first consonant on the columns, and the vowels for the rows. 

<b>Formats include:</b>
* 28 .csv files
* JSON objects are to be determined

<b>For testing purposes, and demonstrations, we have a testing folder</b>
