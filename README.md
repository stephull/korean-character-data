# korean-character-data
Dataset for all possible combinations of Korean alphabet

### Purpose
This repository holds all possible combinations of the Korean alphabet.
Each file contains all possible combinations based on first consonant and vowel combinations.
Each file is differentiated by its, or lack of, second consonant, which concludes the unique Korean character. 

The data is intended for a personal project of mine, although this dataset is publically available to anyone who needs a dataset of Korean characters. 

### Available Formats
* XLSX
* CSV
* JSON (TBA)
