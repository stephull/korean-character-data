# korean-character-data
Dataset for all possible combinations of Korean alphabet

## Purpose
This repository holds all possible combinations of the Korean alphabet. Each file contains all possible combinations based on first consonant and vowel combinations, with each .csv and .json object file differentiating every array of characters by its, or lack of, second consonant, which concludes the unique Korean character. 

<b>The data is intended for a personal project of mine, although this dataset is publically available to anyone who needs a dataset of Korean characters. </b>

## Contents
<b>Formats include:</b>
* CSV - CSV files, sorted by both first and last consonants, and includes file for all letters
* JSON - JSON encoded object file sorted by first consonant
* NPY - Numpy array file sorted by first consonant

<b>For testing purposes, and demonstrations, see tests-and-demos.ipynb</b>
